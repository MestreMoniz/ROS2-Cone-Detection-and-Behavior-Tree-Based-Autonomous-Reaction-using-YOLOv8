# ROS2-Cone-Detection-and-Behavior-Tree-Based-Autonomous-Reaction-using-YOLOv8
This ROS2 project uses YOLOv8 for cone detection and a custom Behavior Tree node to trigger a 360ยบ rotation on detection. Using Nav2 and costmap filters, the robot slows near cones for safer navigation, separating perception from reactive behavior.
